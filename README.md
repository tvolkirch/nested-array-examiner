Nested Array Examiner Module

This code is a module with functions and properties that are used to examine nested arrays. The function to get the array source is destructive to the given array but there's another function that can rebuild a cloned copy of the original. Any number of complete copies can be made.

I created a test array with 801 levels and a 100 elements for each level. None of the functions took more than a couple of hundredths of a second to run with this large array. I didn't leave this array in the code but I left a number of other test cases.

Download the JavaScript code file and modify an HTML file to include the JavaScript file with a script tag. Open the modified HTML file in a browser and check the browser console to see output. Edit the JavaScript code file to go through the test cases and get a feel for how the code works.
